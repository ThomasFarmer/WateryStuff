# A small scale QGIS plugin for an unknown GIS project

This is a pocket-sized automation tool in form of a QGIS plugin for a friend's GIS project contract, which i know very little about. The sole purpose of this project is to perform 3 basic tasks on 3 pre-existing layers:
- F_RESZVIZGY : a polygon layer storing Watershed locations and metadata
- P_CSAPADEKMERO : a point layer storing rain gauge locations and metadata
- P_CSOMOPONT : a point layer storing intersection point locations and metadata
